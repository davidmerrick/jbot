Kotlin Slack bot using [JBot](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot).

Implemented as an incident response bot.

# Getting started

1. Create a Slack bot and paste your token into the `application.properties` file.
2. Run the JBotApplication.

# Todo:

- JBot doesn't have capability to create channels. May still want to use [HubSpot's Slack library](https://github.com/HubSpot/slack-client#features) for that.
